## How to setup the server
Use ubuntu as an example:

	sudo apt-get install python python-setuptools sox minimodem
	sudo easy_install pip
	sudo easy_install web.py
	sudo pip install pymongo

Then, in acousauth folder, type
	
	python main.py

If you see something like:

	http://0.0.0.0:8080/
	
You are good to go
