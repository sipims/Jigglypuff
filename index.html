<p>AcousAuth is a smartphone empowered system we designed for personal authentication. It features a seamless, faster, easier and safer user authentication process without the need for special infrastructure. Our system is intended to provide security assurances comparable to or greater than that of conventional authentication systems while offering the same user experience as inputing a password alone. Potentially, any mobile device or computer with microphone and speaker can use AcousAuth, regardless of the hardware and operating system. Our application provides a purely software-based solution to secure smartphone short-range communication without key agreement phase and it is potentially well suited for legacy mobile devices. Despite the computational restrictions and bandwidth of mobile device, our mobile application is able to maintain real-time performance.</p>

<p>Data confidentiality of existing short-range communication systems typically relies on key- exchange then encryption mechanism, which is inefficient. The state-of-the-art NFC-based short-range communication requires special hardware, i.e. NFC chips that are not common on most low-cost smartphones. AcousAuth incorporates keyless acoustic short-range com- munication techniques and an intuitive user interface. To the best of our knowledge, our mobile application demonstrates the first secure cloud-based approach chiefly on friendly jamming technique for acoustic short-range communication.</p>

<p>Our work leverages the following key insights. First, a mobile device can utilize acoustical channel to communicate directly with a cloud-based terminal automatically. Second, it is possible to provide a layered approach to security, whereby a web server can enact different policies depending on presence of the user’s mobile device.</p>

<p>(1) Secure and Robust: AcousAuth employs a purely software-based solution to se- cure smartphone short-range communication without the key agreement phase. In this system, we adopt the emerging friendly jamming technique from radio com- munication for data confidentiality. Therefore, the authentication process is very straightforward and fast. It makes our system robust and enables the short-range personal authentication functionalities without relying on complex supporting in- frastructure. AcousAuth’s security has been analytically and experimentally stud- ied in our previous research paper. We proved that the acoustic-based short-range communication implement in this application is secure and can protect the confi- dentiality of the transmitted data against many passive attacks (e.g. passive blind signal segmentation attacks). Plus, our system is also naturally resistant to many active attacks, like data injection and jamming. This is due to the reason that the carrier frequencies of AcousAuth lie in the audible bandwidth, hence the short- range acoustic communication is noticeable by the users.</p>

<p>(2) Cheap and Compatible: Unlike other techniques such as Bluetooth or NFC, AcousAuth only depends on cellphone’s speaker and microphone to accomplish the authentication process; it does not require any additional hardware. Therefore, the total cost for building up this system can be greatly decreased. In addition to this, the pervasive hardware that we used in our application makes AcousAuth compatible with majority of off-the-shelf mobile devices.</p>

<p>(3) Tunable and Customizable: The cloud-based architecture allows user to control AcousAuth through our incredibly simple online GUI. The tunability of this carrier frequency we used in AcousAuth creates the ability to design a customizable and tunable system.</p>

<p>(4) User centric: In spite of the state-of-the-art technique that we used, our team also focuses on adding user experience enhancing features into our application. We capture and represent essential demand of users which result in building a user centric application. The prototype for demonstration is well designed and we make it visually appealing to target market.</p>
